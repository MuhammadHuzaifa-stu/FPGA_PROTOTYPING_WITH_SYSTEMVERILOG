To set up on Linux, simply run `make`. After that, you can open Verdi using `./opengui`. If you want to view the coverage reports, run `make view_cov`.

To set up on Windows, manually add the required files to your simulator. Once the files are included, you can proceed to run the simulation or perform synthesis as needed.
