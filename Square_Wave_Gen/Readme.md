To burn the design onto an *FPGA*, you can use either `ILA` or `LED`. If you choose to use `LED`, ensure that the *square_wave_out* frequency is reduced to a lower value. This can be done by increasing the `OFFSET` in *square_wave*. Note that the `OFFSET` value must be a power of `2^n`. Otherwise, tools like VCS or Vivado may infer multiplier blocks for expressions like `(n x OFFSET)` or `(m x OFFSET)`.
