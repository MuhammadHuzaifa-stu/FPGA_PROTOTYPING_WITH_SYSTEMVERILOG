/**
 * Fibonacci Calculator
 *
 * This module calculates Fibonacci numbers with a parameterized input.
 * The input is currently set to a maximum value of `31` (5 bits). 
 * While this value can be increased, caution is advised as Fibonacci 
 * numbers grow exponentially, which may lead to resource constraints 
 * or overflow in hardware implementations.
 *
 * Key Notes:
 * - Input: Parameterized, default maximum is `31` (5 bits).
 * - Output: Fibonacci sequence value corresponding to the input.
 * - Warning: Increasing the input range may result in large outputs 
 *   that could exceed hardware or system limits.
